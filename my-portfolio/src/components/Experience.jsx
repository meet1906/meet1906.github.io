              What started as a web dev internship turned into a full-blown journey through the trenches of product building. At Artifik, a next-gen KGV (Knowledge Governance) & KAV (Knowledge Acquisition & Validation) platform based in Norway, I‚Äôve been part of the story since day one ‚Äî and what a ride it‚Äôs been.

Artifik has grown from a single-page prototype to a game-changing solution now used by 1,000+ organizations, generating 1M+ NOK in ARR, and powering better procurement decisions across the country.

My role & impact:

üõ† Built from the Ground Up: From early dev work to now leading as Project Manager, I‚Äôve been hands-on through 42 production releases, 55 sprints, and 150 total builds ‚Äî steering the ship through v0 to v3.03.

üì¶ 500+ Features Shipped: Drove delivery of over 500 features, 1100+ bug fixes, and 2,000+ completed tasks over 2.5 years.

üîÅ Scrum & Delivery Lead: Managed product planning, handled sprint logistics, and ensured smooth, high-quality rollouts ‚Äî with an eye always on impact.

ü§ù Bridge Between Tech & Business: I‚Äôm the go-to link between devs, designers, and stakeholders ‚Äî translating product vision into deliverables that move the needle.

Artifik isn‚Äôt just a job ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a startup inside a startup. The growth has been wild, the learnings immense, and we‚Äôre just getting started.

              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              4 versions. 15 clients. Countless lessons.
Prevale was my crash course in everything ‚Äî tech, business, finance, legal, marketing, HR. As co-founder, I wore every hat in the startup wardrobe and built alongside a team of hustlers and dreamers. Our mission? To reimagine compliance and accounting for Indian businesses.

From a coffee shop epiphany to a full-stack SaaS product, I helped lead Prevale through:

V1: A quick-fire tool to export client data into Tally ‚Äî functional, fast, and brutally ignored by the market.

V2: A task-based tri-user workflow system ‚Äî clever but technically rigid. A system too early for its own good.

V3: A dynamic, customizable productivity engine that accountants actually loved. Events, clients, traction ‚Äî it was real.

V4: The hard truth ‚Äî scaling both sides of a two-sided market isn't just hard; it's often unsustainable.

We tried, failed, pivoted, scaled, rebuilt ‚Äî and ultimately chose to sunset it in May 2025. Not out of defeat, but with clarity and grace.

üìå Highlights:

Built 4 major versions, shipping over 500 features, 1000+ tasks, and supporting 15 active clients

Led product strategy, tech architecture, and business ops end-to-end

Grew from zero to a real brand in compliance tech, exploring registrations, trademarks, microsourcing, and more

Documented the entire journey in a no-holds-barred Medium post

Prevale taught me the most important lesson of all: building is not about hype ‚Äî it's about humility, execution, and learning fast.

We‚Äôre not done ‚Äî just between versions.

              As of a part of comono ecosystem, Inspera trusted me with one of their most critical tools: a custom Data Analytics engine that‚Äôs now used by their biggest client and internally across teams. It wasn‚Äôt just about building a product ‚Äî it was about enabling smarter, faster, and more impactful decisions company-wide.
We built a data discovery tool to help analyse data for higher graduation universities understand assesments and students better as consultant
Mainly my role was about managing project using Jira, running scrum and stakeholder meetings, writing reports and sometimes doing internal demos for the product and making sure there is sync between the requirements and developers understanding those requirements :)   </p>

Team & Process Leadership: Ran daily scrum meetings, planning, and reviews, streamlining communication across tech, product, and clinical teams.
AI/ML Contributions: Collaborated with data scientists and psychologists to create a custom mental health dataset. Applied algorithms like Linear & Logistic Regression and Random Forest to build insights and recommendations, using platforms like Tableau, IBM SPSS, and Azure ML Studio.
Tech & Infrastructure: Spearheaded database design and architecture for the entire application suite.
Strategy & Ownership: Eventually promoted to Product Owner, leading technical roadmaps and execution strategies to scale the program across schools.

As Executive and later Head Manager at the Electronic City Campus, I helped scale this first-of-its-kind flipped-classroom model where students became the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
My role spanned:
Program Leadership: Managed end-to-end operations ‚Äî from onboarding SMEs to organizing cross-domain sessions that blended co-curriculars and extra-curriculars.
Community Building: Built bridges between batches, encouraging juniors to learn directly from their seniors, and empowering SMEs to share deep knowledge in everything from tech to design to life skills.
Culture Catalyst: Fostered an environment where learning was curiosity-driven, interactive, and radically student-led ‚Äî making it one of the most intellectually vibrant corners of campus.
The result? Dozens of sessions, hundreds of students impacted, and a cultural shift in how learning was perceived at PESU.

It was a masterclass in purpose-led marketing, product storytelling, and using tech for good.
