I’ve led everything from strategic vision to legal hustle — partnering with incredible startups like Artifik and scaleups like Inspera.

              As a part of comono ecosystem, I serve as project manager for Artifik which is a next generation KGV and KAV platform developed to help procurers and bidders buy and bid better 
              From day one, I’ve been in the trenches with Artifik — watching it evolve from a barebones page to a powerhouse platform revolutionizing knowledge governance (KGV & KAV) in Norway. Now serving 1,000+ organizations and clocking 1M+ NOK in ARR, Artifik is on fire — started as a web developer intern on the project , paved my path to project management and scrum and now alongside handling the releases , I’m the glue between tech and business, ensuring every sprint moves the needle.

              A wild ride of 4 versions, 15 clients, and countless lessons. At Prevale, I was a full-stack generalist — architecting tech, managing finance, navigating legal frameworks, and even steering marketing campaigns. 

We aimed to reimagine compliance and accounting for Indian businesses. Though we eventually sunset the product, the journey was a masterclass in resilience, iteration, and bold execution. I wrote about it all here. 

Spoiler: it’s raw, real, and full of gold.

              As of a part of comono ecosystem, Inspera trusted me with one of their most critical tools: a custom Data Analytics engine that’s now used by their biggest client and internally across teams. It wasn’t just about building a product — it was about enabling smarter, faster, and more impactful decisions company-wide.
We built a data discovery tool to help analyse data for higher graduation universities understand assesments and students better as consultant
Mainly my role was about managing project using Jira, running scrum and stakeholder meetings, writing reports and sometimes doing internal demos for the product and making sure there is sync between the requirements and developers understanding those requirements :)   </p>

As the bridge between stakeholders, product teams, and schools, I owned the product side from ideation to implementation.
Product Design: Helped architect user workflows for the LMM Secret Diary mobile app and counsellor-facing web platform — tools built to bring structured emotional support into classrooms.
Team & Process Leadership: Ran daily scrum meetings, planning, and reviews, streamlining communication across tech, product, and clinical teams.
AI/ML Contributions: Collaborated with data scientists and psychologists to create a custom mental health dataset. Applied algorithms like Linear & Logistic Regression and Random Forest to build insights and recommendations, using platforms like Tableau, IBM SPSS, and Azure ML Studio.
Tech & Infrastructure: Spearheaded database design and architecture for the entire application suite.
Strategy & Ownership: Eventually promoted to Product Owner, leading technical roadmaps and execution strategies to scale the program across schools.
This wasn’t just a job — it was an opportunity to blend empathy, tech, and data to create real, lasting impact.

As Executive and later Head Manager at the Electronic City Campus, I helped scale this first-of-its-kind flipped-classroom model where students became the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
My role spanned:
Program Leadership: Managed end-to-end operations — from onboarding SMEs to organizing cross-domain sessions that blended co-curriculars and extra-curriculars.
Community Building: Built bridges between batches, encouraging juniors to learn directly from their seniors, and empowering SMEs to share deep knowledge in everything from tech to design to life skills.
Culture Catalyst: Fostered an environment where learning was curiosity-driven, interactive, and radically student-led — making it one of the most intellectually vibrant corners of campus.
The result? Dozens of sessions, hundreds of students impacted, and a cultural shift in how learning was perceived at PESU.

Brand & Social Media: Handled Vincere’s professional social handles, crafting content that resonated with purpose and reached the right audiences.
Sales & Outreach: Led efforts to engage target brands and partners, driving early-stage traction for key products.
Product Marketing – KRIDA: Focused on one of Vincere’s flagship products, KRIDA — a tech tool designed to detect intellectual disabilities in children aged 6–10. I played a key role in product pitching, designing go-to-market strategies, and communicating its social value to stakeholders.
It was a masterclass in purpose-led marketing, product storytelling, and using tech for good.
