              What started as a web dev internship turned into a full-blown journey through the trenches of product building. At Artifik, a next-gen KGV (Knowledge Governance) & KAV (Knowledge Acquisition & Validation) platform based in Norway, I‚Äôve been part of the story since day one ‚Äî and what a ride it‚Äôs been.

Artifik has grown from a single-page prototype to a game-changing solution now used by 1,000+ organizations, generating 1M+ NOK in ARR, and powering better procurement decisions across the country.

My role & impact:

üõ† Built from the Ground Up: From early dev work to now leading as Project Manager, I‚Äôve been hands-on through 42 production releases, 55 sprints, and 150 total builds ‚Äî steering the ship through v0 to v3.03.

üì¶ 500+ Features Shipped: Drove delivery of over 500 features, 1100+ bug fixes, and 2,000+ completed tasks over 2.5 years.

üîÅ Scrum & Delivery Lead: Managed product planning, handled sprint logistics, and ensured smooth, high-quality rollouts ‚Äî with an eye always on impact.

ü§ù Bridge Between Tech & Business: I‚Äôm the go-to link between devs, designers, and stakeholders ‚Äî translating product vision into deliverables that move the needle.

Artifik isn‚Äôt just a job ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a startup inside a startup. The growth has been wild, the learnings immense, and we‚Äôre just getting started.

We aimed to reimagine compliance and accounting for Indian businesses. Though we eventually sunset the product, the journey was a masterclass in resilience, iteration, and bold execution. I wrote about it all here.

We built a data discovery tool to help analyse data for higher graduation universities understand assesments and students better as consultant
Mainly my role was about managing project using Jira, running scrum and stakeholder meetings, writing reports and sometimes doing internal demos for the product and making sure there is sync between the requirements and developers understanding those requirements :)   </p>

The result? Dozens of sessions, hundreds of students impacted, and a cultural shift in how learning was perceived at PESU.
