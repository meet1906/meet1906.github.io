During the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, I helped build and scale a student-led emergency response community at PES University ‚Äî mobilizing over 500 volunteers to deliver real help on the ground.

üöë Coordinated and responded to 100+ critical SOS requests ‚Äî from arranging oxygen cylinders to securing hospital beds.
üì≤ Led efforts in verifying leads and resources, cutting through the noise and misinformation when it mattered most.
üèôÔ∏è Collaborated across student networks to support Namma Bengaluru ‚Äî with speed, empathy, and action.

What started as a WhatsApp group became a movement ‚Äî proof that when communities rise, hope spreads faster than panic.

Key Highlights:

Took the entire hackathon online, creating a seamless virtual experience for participants across time zones.

Pulled in 700+ registrations globally, making it the most diverse and wide-reaching edition to date.

Managed cross-functional teams handling logistics, tech support, marketing, and judging ‚Äî all within a tight 24-hour, high-stakes window.

It wasn‚Äôt just a hackathon. It was a global celebration of tech, innovation, and resilience ‚Äî and I was proud to be behind the curtain making it happen.

              I was one of the 8 founding members of the ACM Student Chapter at PESU-ECC ‚Äî a global tech community brought to life on campus with a mission to elevate learning, leadership, and hands-on industry exposure.

We didn‚Äôt just start a club ‚Äî we built a legacy.

Key Initiatives:

üõ† ACM Industrial Experience Program: Co-designed this flagship initiative to give students real-world, industry-level exposure while still in university. What started as an experiment is now a well-oiled machine ‚Äî still running strong in its 6th year, helping students bridge the gap between theory and practice.

üåç Hacktoberfest @ PESU: Launched campus-wide open source drives during Hacktoberfest to promote contributions to global OSS projects, foster peer learning, and grow a culture of collaboration.

From hosting events and mentoring peers to creating programs that still run today, my time at ACM was all about sparking momentum that lasted well beyond my own graduation.

              As part of the founding team of DSC PESIT, I helped lay the foundation for one of Google Developers‚Äô most impactful university programs ‚Äî aimed at skilling student developers and empowering them to solve real-world problems through technology.

Key Contributions:

Developer Relations & Community Building: Mentored students in the emerging space of developer relations and community management, helping them grow not just as coders, but as collaborative, impact-driven technologists.

GCP & Tech Evangelism: Guided peers through Google Cloud Platform (GCP) challenges and helped them gain hands-on experience with flagship Google tools.

Workshops & Ideathons: Co-hosted events and ideathons that brought theory to life ‚Äî providing mentorship on product thinking, problem-solving, and building scalable solutions for real-world issues.

Culture of Impact: Focused on empowering students to not just build, but build with purpose ‚Äî encouraging open-source contributions, peer-to-peer learning, and real-world application.

Being part of DSC wasn‚Äôt just about tech ‚Äî it was about nurturing a movement of developers who code with community in mind.

              Techwarts wasn‚Äôt just a tech club ‚Äî it was a movement. What started with 8 passionate students became a 500+ strong developer community at PESU‚ÄìECC, uniting coders, creators, and builders across disciplines.

As a co-founder, I helped shape Techwarts into a powerhouse of learning, innovation, and collaboration. The community was built around three core verticals:

Pixel ‚Äì Focused on Augmented & Virtual Reality

Predict This! ‚Äì All about Machine Learning & AI

We the Programmers ‚Äì Competitive Programming and Problem Solving

What we did:

Organized high-energy tech meetups, workshops, hackathons, and speaker sessions that made campus buzz with innovation.

Created a safe, inclusive space for students to experiment, fail, build, and thrive ‚Äî from first-time coders to advanced devs.

Sparked ideas that turned into real startups, and projects that went beyond classrooms.

Techwarts became more than a community ‚Äî it became a launchpad. And being a part of its founding story? One of my proudest chapters.
