        Hey, I’m Meet — a dev-turned-tech project manager who’s all about building cool stuff, whether it's software, products, or communities. I run a consulting company helping EU clients make an impact, while also crafting products back home in India. 
        Alongside being a CSE graduate of PES University (ECC), I’ve been deeply involved in tech communities and the startup ecosystem. When I’m not managing projects or building solutions, you’ll find me traveling, anchoring events, or geeking out over the next big idea.
